# SemanticSegmentation
A project based Semantic Segmentation for the course on Neural Networks (Theory and Implenentation) at Universit√§t des Saarlandes, Germany.

## Task 1 : 
Semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC Dataset using R2UNET Arch.

## Task 2 :
Semantic segmentation on Cityscapes Dataset using R2UNET Arch.

## Task 3 : 
Semantic segmentation on Cityscapes Dataset using a modified version of R2UNET Arch. Here, the depth of the architecture has been increased which gives better results as compared to the original R2UNET architecture.
