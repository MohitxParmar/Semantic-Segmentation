# SemanticSegmentation
A project based on neural networks for semantic segmentation 

Task 1 : Semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC Dataset using R2UNET Arch.
Task 2 : Semantic segmentation on Cityscapes Dataset using R2UNET Arch.
Task 3 : Semantic segmentation on Cityscapes Dataset using a modified version of R2UNET Arch. Here, the depth of the architecture has been increased which gives better results as compared to the original R2UNET architecture.
